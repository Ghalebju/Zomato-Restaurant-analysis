# Zomato-Restaurant-analysis:
# Project description:

This project is about analysing restaurants in the city of Bangalore in India. We downloaded a data set that includes more than 20.000 different restaurants, from the least expensive to the most expensive one. 
Our main goal was to analyse how does the cost of meal will affect customers behaviour when it comes to evaluating the restaurant. We analysed the relationship between the approximated cost for two people to eat in each restaurant and the number of votes the restaurant has.
