# Zomato-Restaurant-analysis:
# Project description:
This project is about analysing restaurants in the city of Bangalore in India. We downloaded a data set that includes more than 20.000 different restaurants, from the least expensive to the most expensive ones. 
Our main goal was to analyse how does the cost of meal affect customers behaviour when it comes to evaluating the restaurant. I analysed the relationship between the approximated cost for two people to eat in each restaurant and the rating of the restaurant.

# Data Source: Kaggle.com

# Folder content:
In the uploaded folder you can find all the python notebooks I worked on for the analysis.
You can also find the last updated data set (after cleaning, consistency checks) with only quantitative variables. This data set was the one used for the regression analysis and the clustering analysis. 

We also finished our work by preparing a Tableau presentation for the whole project.
